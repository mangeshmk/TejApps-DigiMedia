Shop on the Go</strong></p>
<p><strong>How Tesco virtually created a new market on a country's lifestyle<br>
  </strong><br>
  <strong>  Executive Summary<br>
  </strong>South Koreans have amongst the longest working hours in the world, with young, upwardly mobile executives often too busy to go shopping for grocery at a traditional store. The UK's giant retailer, Tesco, sought to turn this disadvantage to its benefit. It introduced &quot;virtual stores&quot;, which are essentially a display of products on walls of metro stations and bus stops. Commuters, especially the tech-savvy, ultra-busy lot, could scan the QR codes of the products on display with their smartphones, and place their orders even as they waited for their trains or buses. This case study looks at how Tesco &quot;virtually&quot; created a new market based on a country's lifestyle.<br>
  <br>
  In 2011, when domestic sales of the UK's retail giant Tesco slumped, it fell back on its second-largest market, Asia, which accounted for 30 per cent of its total profit. Tesco's success in Asia, and specifically in South Korea - currently its largest market outside the UK - is based on its ability to adapt to the local consumer.<br>
  <br>
  Tesco's expansion into Asia has been an important focus for the company since the late 1990s. Following its acquisition of Thailand's Lotus in May 1998, the company announced a 142-million investment in South Korea in March 1999 by partnering with Samsung to develop hypermarkets. Through its tie-up with Samsung, Tesco made a localisation effort to adapt its Homeplus stores to the local consumer.<br>
  <br>
  The latest example of this localisation was the launch in 2011 of its first virtual store, located in a Seoul subway station, an idea based on the observation that the typical Seoul commuter did not have the time to shop at her nearest brick-and-mortar Homeplus store.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Virtual Store</strong><br>
  The virtual stores are set up in public spaces, most often in subways and bus stops with high foot traffic and frequented daily by tech-savvy commuters. This is how such stores work:<br>
  <br>
  - They then use their smartphones to scan the QR codes of the products they want to purchase. The posters in the virtual stores are designed to resemble the actual aisles and shelves of a regular Tesco store, making the experience very user-friendly.<br>
  <br>
  - The scanned products are stored in the customers' online shopping basket, who pay online once their order is completed. Homeplus reported that the majority of the orders are placed at 10 am and 4 pm, when people are commuting to and from work.<br>
  <br>
  - Customers schedule a time for home delivery. Same-day delivery is the norm, so that customers can get their products by the time they get back home from work.<br>
  <br>
  The virtual store has been a huge success with commuters and drove over 900,000 app downloads in less than one year, making the Homeplus app the most popular shopping app in South Korea. Online sales increased 130 per cent since the introduction of the virtual stores and registered app users increased by 76 per cent. In February 2012, Tesco Homeplus announced it was extending the virtual store concept to 20 new locations across the country. Today, there are 22 Homeplus virtual stores in South Korea, and the brand is the country's No. 1 online retailer.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Understanding the Consumer</strong><br>
  South Korea, a country of around 50 million people, is the fourth-largest economy in Asia and the 12th largest in the world. Compared to other Asian countries, South Koreans generally have higher levels of education, higher average household income, and better living standards. Over the past few decades, the country has built itself up with its largest resource - people - and has achieved rapid economic growth through exports of manufactured goods. It is now a major producer of automobiles, electronics, steel and high-technology products such as digital monitors, mobile phones, and semiconductors.<br>
  <br>
  Over the past decade, South Korea has advanced tremendously and has been shaped by constant innovation, technology and westernisation. In today's world, shopping habits and behaviour of South Korean consumers are impacted by several key factors.<br>
  <br>
  Extensive use of technology/connectivity: According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Co., South Korea is one of the most advanced countries in terms of broadband penetration, and has more than 10 million smartphone users. In other words, one in five South Koreans use a smartphone. Additionally, according to Nielsen, households in South Korea are making six per cent fewer shopping trips. When they do shop for products, an increasing number of South Koreans go online.<br>
  <br>
  Long working hours/busy lifestyle: Although the average annual hours worked per person in South Korea is declining, the country still comes out top among OECD countries with 2,193 hours. This is perhaps unsurprising, as the work ethic and lifestyle of South Koreans get shaped at a young age. According to the BBC, South Korean parents spend thousands of pounds a year on after-school tuition on an industrial scale. There are just under 100,000 hagwons or private academies in South Korea and around three-quarters of Korean children attend them.<br>
  <br>
  Travel time on public transportation: South Koreans spend a significant amount of time on public transportation, predominantly between home and work. What has helped is that public transportation is reliable and inexpensive, and is the fastest and most efficient way to get around.<br>
  <br>
  The introduction of Tesco's virtual stores in subways made use of time spent by commuters waiting for public transportation, allowing buyers to use the little time they have available for grocery shopping. Not only did this change the way buyers shopped, it also increased the potential market for Tesco. These buyers may not have otherwise had time to go grocery shopping between their personal and professional lives, opting to buy take-out instead.<br>
  <br>
  All of this implies that grocery customers in South Korea are more time-poor and less price-sensitive. They value convenience and technology to accommodate their busy lifestyle.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Tesco's Value Proposition<br>
  <br>
  </strong>Buying on the move: Tesco's virtual stores in subways made use of time spent by commuters waiting for public transportation (Image Courtesy : Lildoremi.org)<br>
  Globally, Tesco's customers are price-driven buyers who look for value and/or convenience. According to its corporate website, Tesco's customers care about the following areas: (1) price and value (2) multichannel and convenience, and (3) trust. Typically, therefore, the company's value proposition is to provide customers with the products that they want at a low price. Tesco executes this proposition through multiple channels, including hypermarkets, grocery stores, convenience stores and online. When Tesco first entered South Korea, it offered this value proposition for the local customer: to provide the variety of products that the South Korean customer wants at a low cost in a beautiful store environment.<br>
  <br>
  As the economy progressed and South Koreans invested more time and money into their careers and high-tech devices, Tesco adapted its value proposition to fit its on-the-go customers. By introducing the virtual store, Tesco Homeplus is able to execute its new localised value proposition: provide the variety of products that the customer wants in a convenient location and at a low cost.<br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, it can be argued that Tesco's customer values multichannel options (for example, online and mobile), and convenience much more than price. According to a March 2013 research from MasterCard, around 40 per cent of online shoppers in South Korea used their smartphones to make a purchase in the previous three months.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Image-value-experience Triangle<br>
  <br>
  </strong>In addition to the virtual store's strong value proposition, Homeplus has also developed a strong image and experience that mutually reinforce this value proposition. The Homeplus virtual stores attract their customers through their quick, tech-savvy, and cool image. They sell to their customer by offering the value of extreme convenience that the customer requires. And they are able to keep their customers by offering them the satisfying experience of easy-to-use technology, on-time delivery and quality products.<br>
  <br>
  Given that the South Korean on-the-go customer places much greater value on convenience than on low prices, Tesco Homeplus may have been enticed to increase product prices through their virtual store channel. However, we believe that Homeplus decided not to increase prices in order to maintain its overall Homeplus value proposition, which hinges on providing desired products at low prices.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>  Key Learnings<br>
  <br>
  </strong><strong>This case study highlights important learnings that can be applied, generally, to other businesses:<br>
  <br>
  </strong><strong>Customer-based marketing</strong>: A &quot;real-world&quot; application of the new marketing paradigm, in which the process starts with the consumer and his or her needs, as opposed to with the product.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Customer segmentation</strong>: When you enter a new market/geography, companies need to understand and analyse consumer behaviour trends, including shopping habits and purchasing behaviour, to identify who the valued customers are and how they behave.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Adaptation of value proposition</strong>: If the needs, attitudes and lifestyle of the company's &quot;value customer&quot; are different in the new market/geography, the company needs to adapt its value proposition and value network across the entire supply chain.<br>
  <br>
  Power of technology in traditional industries: Technology has a disruptive power in traditional industries, such as retailing. In this case, the predominance of smartphones in Korea allowed Tesco to boost its revenues through an innovative approach.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Innovative marketing</strong>: The way marketing can be used innovatively to target captured audiences (such as commuters waiting for the next train in a station).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Brand Extension</strong>: One option that Tesco Homeplus may have considered in order to take advantage of is to create a new brand for the virtual stores that would have remained independent from the Homeplus brand and, therefore, limited the risk to the Homeplus brand by increasing prices.</p>

    <br>
    The world's largest coffee retailer, Starbucks, pulled itself out of the financial meltdown of 2008 by aligning its operations with customer demands through social media.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:<br>
    <br>
    </strong>The world's largest coffee retailer, Starbucks, pulled itself out of the financial meltdown of 2008 by aligning its operations with customer demands through social media. This case study looks at what the company did right to achieve this turnaround.<br>
    <br>
    Founded in 1971 in Seattle, Starbucks is present in 50 states in the US and 43 countries. It is one of the most respected brands, winning awards such as &quot;Best Business&quot;, &quot;Most Admired Company&quot;, &quot;100 Best Corporate Citizens&quot; and so on. While its quality is unquestionable, its price has always been higher than those offered by the domestic coffee houses in various countries.<br>
    <br>
    This was one of the reasons why the company took a hit during the economic slowdown of 2008 as customers opted for cheaper options for their everyday coffee. Starbucks was forced to shut 600 shops that were not making profits. By March 30, 2008, its profit had fallen 28 per cent compared to the same period in 2007. In 2009, it closed another 300 stores and laid off 6,700 employees.</p>
<p>On January 8, 2008, Howard D. Schultz returned as CEO of Starbucks after a gap of eight years, replacing Jim Donald. Schultz had nurtured the company since 1982 when it had only four outlets. He had served as CEO from 1987 to 2000 and had presided over the companys public offering in 1992.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>    Branding unlimited: Starbucks cups on sale at a store.<br>
    </strong>Upon coming back, he found that apart from the worsening economic condition in the US, the company's rapid expansion had distracted it from making its cafes an inviting place with new products. In addition, Starbucks also faced competition from McDonald's, which had, in 2008, started setting up coffee bars that sold espresso.<br>
    <br>
    Schultz shot off a letter to the employees on the day he took office once again as CEO. He said, &quot;The company must shift its focus away from bureaucracy and back to customers.&quot; He made his objective very clear: &quot;Reigniting the emotional attachment with customers.</p>
  <p>&quot;The previous leadership had blamed the economy and the higher cost of dairy products for the slump in business. They had also stated this as a reason to hike prices. However, Schultz took an entirely different view of the situation. He told the employees, &quot;The company shouldn't just blame the economy; Starbucks's heavy spending to accommodate its expansion has created a bureaucracy that masked its problems.&quot;</p>
  <p>In a departure from conventional strategies like &quot;a redo of the store layout&quot;, Starbucks soon embarked on a technology-oriented strategy. An environment where employees could think freely about the organisation and contribute in terms of strategies and ideas was fostered. As a result, a community involvement concept was developed.</p>
  <p>In March 2008, &quot;My Starbucks Idea&quot; was rolled out for customers to exchange ideas with each other and directly with the company. As part of this, customers were able to give opinions on everything such as products, services, layout, advertising, corporate social responsibility, in-store music and so on. More than 93,000 ideas were shared by about 1.3 million users on social media, and page views per month rose to 5.5 million.</p>
  <p>After the 2007/08 crisis, Starbucks had to rebuild its customer relationships and show the world that it cared for quality and consistency. It also had to give a leg up to the altruistic component of the brand such as community building and care for the environment. Through the &quot;My Starbucks Idea&quot; customers had a direct link with the headquarters and of course Starbucks was listening. Soon Starbucks's ubiquity became an asset as customers from around the world had an opportunity to connect with each other, spawning like-minded communities like the 'free Wi-Fi group', 'soy group', 'comfy chair group' or 'frappuccino lovers'.</p>
  <p>Starbucks implemented over 100 ideas. Through this initiative, the coffee retailer built a robust fan base. By giving customers a platform to voice their ideas and views on the brand and by responding to it, it was able to reignite the brand trust.</p>
  <p>Starbucks soon realised that it had to project its 'cool' element via social media-based marketing. The organisation must never look desperate or too keen to increase its sales. So the company refrained from pushing too many products, causes or offers to its followers. The focus was more on building and engaging with the community.</p>
  <p>One of the accidental tweets from Starbucks was just a smiley face that received a lot of admiration from the community. Tweets such as 'keep calm and make coffee' is in line with its idea of keeping a cool image and building a community. Starbucks's use of social media points to the fine balance it maintained between spontaneous and well-planned posts. The social media platforms have also helped the company swiftly mitigate and manage any information that causes harm to its global identity. In 2009, when rumours of Starbucks's profits being spent on Israel army surfaced, the company used the social media outlets effectively to refute it and restore its image of a peace-loving organisation.</p>
  <p><strong>MOBILE APPS</strong></p>
  <p>The company embraced mobile apps much before its competitors. Very early in the race, Starbucks had linked its social media strategy objectives with technology channels like mobile apps. It was carefully designed to appeal to the masses and specifically to the segment that made up its online community. Through its iPhone app features like store locator, nutrition-based information and rewards programme, it integrated and enhanced its social media community fabric. The head start in technology adoption has helped the company come up with trend-setting ideas.</p>
  <p>One of them was the move to help its customers personalise the company's offerings. The initiative, 'MyStarbucksSignature' allowed consumers to develop their own signature drinks (hot or cold coffee), name the drink and share the new flavour with the community. In this way, Starbucks informs the consumer of the wide range of product offering they have at their stores across the world. It also shows the consumer how to order this cup and what it will look like. The only modification a consumer can do in his or her signature drink is in the ingredient mix and quantity. This way the supply network is only slightly disrupted at the retail and service end. Everything else related to ingredients and distribution remains completely untouched.</p>
  <p>In 2008, the marketing teams had started a promotion to increase customer visits to stores during breakfast hours. It included a free pastry with a coffee bought before 10:30 a.m. The initiative created traction online and over one million people across the US queued up at Starbucks outlets.</p>
  <p>Such social media promotions were much less expensive than the companys promotions at its stores or putting up billboards across cities. The awareness and response was also more than that from promotions through traditional channels like television advertisements.</p>
  <p>Employees and baristas too were always an integral part of Starbucks online and social media community. It has a separate page for its employees, which is used to generate and debate ideas.</p>
  <p>An example of employees contributing to its success is its Twitter page. The chain's voice on Twitter is 28-year-old Brad Nelson, a former barista. In 2008, when the company was looking for ideas to re-engage with its customers, Nelson suggested that he could begin a Twitter handle for the brand. Today, Starbucks has 775,000 followers.</p>

	              1) Poor visibility in Top 3 search results for Postpaid, Prepaid and DTH related keywords</p>
      <p>Airtel had very good presence and authority in the telecom sector. It was appearing in top 10 search results for a huge number of industry related terms and keywords, but it was not visible in the top 3 results for most of these terms. Other key players, like Vodafone and Idea Cellular were dominating the Top 3 search results for Postpaid and Prepaid products and plans. Whereas, the new entrant Jio, dominated in prepaid related searches.</p>
                  <p>For DTH, Airtel had decent presence and appeared for a number of keywords in top 10 search results. However, competitors like Dish TV, Tata Sky and Videocon and some smaller providers like DEN, captured top 3 search results for many of the keywords.</p>
                  <p>2) Low rankings for Local Keywords for Broadband and Postpaid Lines of Business (LOB)</p>
                  <p>For Broadband the presence was there in top results, but a lot of local and regional service providers like DEN, Broadway, Hathway, etc. appeared more for generic queries in different regions and completely dominated the top 3 or top 10 results in some cases, for local or regional queries.</p>
                  <p>There were similar issues with Local keywords for Postpaid.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Solution</strong><br>
                    To get maximum keywords in top 3 search results</p>
                  <p>We pulled out a list of over 2000 keywords across all 4 Products - Postpaid, Prepaid, Broadband and DTH. We divided the keywords into 3 buckets and worked on different strategies for each:</p>
                  <p><strong>For Bucket 1: Keywords ranking in Top 10 Results</strong></p>
                  <p>1. We identified all keywords in Top 10 whose CTR was less than the average CTR for all keywords in the bucket. And worked on optimizing the meta titles to improve the CTR.</p>
                  <p>2. Optimized on-page SEO elements and improved content for all the target landing pages.</p>
                  <p><strong>For Bucket 2&amp; 3: Keywords ranking between 11-20 Results and beyond Top 20 Results</strong></p>
                  <p>3. In addition to the on-page changes mentioned above, we also did aggressive link building to improve authority and popularity of the landing pages on which these keywords were targeted. We obtained a healthy mix of high authority links and high-quality theme-based links.</p>
                  <p>4. Worked with the Development team to improve page speed of all the target landing pages.</p>
                  <p><strong>To improve performance of Local Keywords</strong></p>
                  <p>First, we pulled out the complete list of all locations or cities Airtel had their presence in or wanted to target. The target locations were different for both the products – For Postpaid, the target was 440 cities across the country. For Broadband the target was the circles (states) in country and some major cities in these circles.<br>
                    <br>
                    We then researches all combinations of keywords for the target cities and circles and prepared a comprehensive keywords list.<br>
                    <br>
                    Next we prepared separate landing pages for each of the target locations for both products.<br>
                    <br>
                    We did complete local optimization of all these pages including creation of Google My Business (GMB) listings for each physical outlet for each city.<br>
                    <br>
                    We also did comprehensive on page optimization right from content to other on page elements.<br>
                    <br>
                    For the newly created local pages, we built back links via off page activities to increase their authority and popularity.<br>
                    <br>
                    To drive more link juice to these city pages, we interlinked them to each other and also from the main product pages for Postpaid and Broadband.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>                    The Results<br>
                    Top 3 Rankings</strong></p>
                  <p>We managed to drive an unprecedented 2100+Keywords into Top 3 position, across all 4 products, over the 12 month engagement. Only 255 keywords were in Top 3 when we started in January ’17.</p>

		        <div class="acc-content">
		          <p>	               <strong>Quora Content Marketing Case Study</strong><br>
		            <br>
		            <strong>		            About the Client<br>
	                  </strong>Bajaj Finserv Limited is the holding company for the businesses dealing with financial services of the Bajaj Group. It independently runs the core businesses of Lending, Insurance and Wealth Advisory. Bajaj Finance Limited is the consumer finance lending arm of Bajaj Finserv Limited.</p>
	            <p>It is the most diversified retail-focused NBFC in the country and the largest financier of consumer durables. Bajaj Finance Limited prides itself for holding the highest credit rating of FAAA/Stable for any NBFC in the country today.</p>
	              <p><strong>The Challenge<br>
                  </strong>Driven by its mission to consistently provide innovative finance solutions across lending, protection and savings domains; Bajaj Finserv wanted help to increase their online visibility of its major products - loan, investment and durable finance such as Home Loan, Personal Loan, Business Loan, Fixed Deposit and EMI finance.</p>
	              <p>The campaign designed aimed to publish content related to loan products on Quora – a popular QnA platform that regularly features in Google search results. The idea was to “influence” customers for loan products who were in the research phase and asking related questions on Quora. It would help the Brand not only get in front of an audience that is “in-market” but build trust and credibility by offering them the right information for informed decision-making.</p>
	              <p><strong>1. Changing mindset </strong>- Our biggest challenge was changing the mindset of the team to start looking at Quora as an influencer marketing platform [as opposed to a mere link building opportunity] and relook at the way we were approaching content creation. It took time to convince the team to create brand neutral content because that was the only way to sound genuine and win the customer’s trust.</p>
	              <p><strong>2. Building trust and credibility </strong>- The next challenge was to rechristen the existing profiles to make them look like genuine, independent contributors in their respective topics of interest.</p>
	              <p><strong>3. Scaling the campaign </strong>- The final challenge was to quickly scale the content marketing campaign so that it would have any measurable impact on business metrics. Otherwise the teams would lose faith in the new strategy and slip back to the old ways of creating content.</p>
	              <p><strong>The Solution</strong><br>
	                <br>
	                <span class="style1"> Strategy &amp; Execution</span></p>
	              <p>We devised and executed a well-researched strategy to identify and answer queries on Quora related to finance domain:</p>
	              <p>The project was kick-started with the creation of a new Quora profile named Arwind Sharma in October of 2015 and a second one named Anamika Verma in October of 2016. Originally, these profiles were created purely for acquiring backlinks for the SEO campaign, but starting August 2017 we changed our approach.</p>
	              <p><strong>The following steps were undertaken to create a stronger presence &amp; authority on Quora:</strong></p>
	              <p><strong>Rebranding the profiles </strong>- we rebranded the profiles to make Arwind Sharma an “independent” expert in Personal Loans and Anamika Verma an “independent” expert in Home Loans &amp; Mortgages, not directly associated with the brand. We thought this approach would work better than both profiles talking about all finance topics. And it did!<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong> Building trust and credibility </strong>– used experience-based storytelling and in many cases, brand-neutral content, to win the trust of users. And referred to external resources for finance-related informative tutorials such as Wikipedia links, Wikihow, etc. to build credibility for the profiles.<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong> Multiple Content Formats </strong>– made full use of Quora platform to create and embed content in multiple formats to engage users in the most effective way. For example, we created an apt explanation of loan application process via a combination of videos, images, step-by-step process.<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong> Identifying “more” questions to answer to drive scale </strong>– we researched all possible topics where we could create content and “influence” users. In addition to obvious topics like home renovation, home purchase, personal finance etc., we got into popular conversations about vacation, weddings, education wherever expenses were being discussed. The increased frequency of content sharing helped us get more views, build more engagement and increase followers.<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong> Facilitating quick resolution </strong>– we tried to be the first to react to user's queries (both product-based and generic) and win their confidence before the competition had the opportunity to influence them in their favor. We used Quora’s profile notifications to help facilitate this.<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong> To-the-point Answers </strong>– created to-the-point answers that quickly solved user’s queries. Further, channelized efforts to improve user experience by reducing hops and direct them to the right query to make informed decisions. This strategy also helped get up-votes for answers and increase visibility.<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong>Creativity &amp; Innovation</strong></p>
	              <p><strong>Experience-based Storytelling </strong>- The most creative part of the campaign was using techniques of experience-based storytelling to “influence” the audiences’ decision-making process.</p>
	              <p>We created answers and subtly promoted the brand using the first-hand experience of our contributors, making them look genuine and trustworthy. We made it look like our two contributors had already been in that situation before and therefore in a position to answer the user’s query.</p>
	              <p><strong>Immersive content experience </strong>- Our biggest innovation was we created content in multiple formats like infographic, video, image, and footnotes to reach the target audience. That too at a time when the competition was not doing it. As a result, our answers got maximum views and upvotes which further fueled views.</p>
	              <p><strong>Infographics </strong>- designed interactive infographics serving as quick product guides. For instance, infographic on online form filling for loan application in 4 simple steps, etc. Integrating them into answers to generate increased viewership.<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong>Videos </strong>- created several videos around products and ‘how to' keywords. For example, how to apply for a personal loan, etc. Again, using them in answers to increase views and engagement.<br>
	                Images - using optimized images to provide refined answers to user queries.<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong> Footnotes </strong>- inserting footnotes in informative tutorials to clarify information and provide details the user is unfamiliar with.<br>
	                <br>
	                This approach helped us garner the ‘trust’ and ‘engagement’ from Quora users. We were able to get Bajaj Finserv into their consideration set and move them along the sales cycle.</p>
	              <p><strong>The Results<br>
                  </strong>Both contributor profiles became “influencers” in their respective domains. The profiles, via the content created, attracted massive views via authentic and high-quality knowledge-sharing. Their answers impacted purchase decisions of users on the platform and prompted them to click through to the Brand’s website.</p>
	              <p><strong>Arwind Sharma<br>
                  </strong>Total profile views of 5,00,826 accumulated in 12 months from August 2017 until July 2018.</p>
	              <p>Starting from 28,781 in Aug 2017 to 68,457 in July 2018 the profile witnessed a 138% growth in monthly organic views.</p>
	              <p>2nd Rank in Personal Loans category</p>
	              <p>4th Rank in Loans category</p>
	              <p><strong>Anamika Verma<br>
                  </strong>The total number of views 1,64,108 accumulated in 12 months from August 2017 until July 2018.</p>
	              <p>Starting from 14,244 in Aug 2017 to 31,400 in July 2018 i.e. the profile witnessed a 120% growth in monthly organic views.</p>
	              <p><strong>Influence and Referral Traffic<br>
                  </strong>By publishing strong, opinionated and thoroughly researched content we helped get Bajaj Finserv in the consideration set when users with purchase intent were researching on Quora. The trust resulted in increased referral traffic. Hence, driving “in-market” audiences to product pages on the brand website.</p>
	              <p><strong>The Recognition<br>
                  </strong>Our new approach and content strategies bagged us multiple recognitions on Quora:</p>
	              <p>1st position in ‘Home Mortgage' for ‘Most Viewed Writers' for Anamika Verma profile<br>
	                2nd position in ‘Personal Loan’ for ‘Most Viewed Writers' for Arwind Sharma profile<br>

	                Product Pages, where similar products from various retailers would be available.<br>
	                We defined the content structure for both sets of pages and then arranged all the product pages in proper subfolders with categories and sub categories. We interlinked them to help users navigate and search engines crawl effectively.</p>
	              <p>With an optimized site structure in place, on-page SEO needed to be performed on both the sections to improve rankings and drive in more traffic.</p>
	              <p><strong>The Solution:<br>
                  </strong>Over a period of 4 months of continuous on-page and off-page SEO activities, beginning January 2014 to April 2014, we saw huge improvements in traffic</p>
	              <p>The graph below shows the comparison of and improvement in the overall traffic (Direct + Referral + Organic) between the time durations of January 2014 – April 2014 and September 2013 – December 2013.</p>
	              <p>&quot;We saw traffic and footfalls to the Baggout site increase by over 330% in a short span of 4 months.&quot;</p>
	              <p><strong>The Results:<br>
                  </strong>Over a period of 4 months of continuous on-page and off-page SEO activities, beginning January 2014 to April 2014, we saw huge improvements in traffic.</p>
	              <p><strong>Results<br>
	              </strong>We saw traffic and footfalls to the Baggout site increase by over 330% in a short span of 4 months.</p>
	              <p>Though 4 months is a very short duration for a website to rank in highly competitive keywords, the rankings also improved considerably. The website now ranked in the top 20 search results for 24 out of the 30 target keywords related to coupons.</p>
	              <p>In addition the website started ranking in Top 5 search results for thousands of long tail product keywords which resulted in massive growth in organic traffic. That was a significant achievement given that the website wasn’t even fully indexed when we received the project.</p>
	              <p>&quot;We helped Baggout gain visibility and rankings faster therefore making the project a success.&quot;</p>
	              <p><strong>The Lesson:<br>
                  </strong>Baggout was a complex project with over 50,000 products from different retailers. Making separate pages for retailers and products helped us rank for thousands of less competitive long tail keywords. While the competition was focused on highly competitive category keywords.</p>
	              <p>This helped us gain visibility and rankings faster therefore making the project a success</p>

		        <div class="acc-content">
		          <p>	               <strong>Video SEO &amp; YouTube Optimization Case Study<br>
	              </strong><br>
	              <strong>	              About the Client<br>
	              </strong>Bajaj Finserv Limited is the holding company for the businesses dealing with financial services of the Bajaj Group. It independently runs the core businesses of Lending, Insurance and Wealth Advisory. Bajaj Finance Limited is the consumer finance lending arm of Bajaj Finserv Limited.</p>
	            <p>It is the most diversified retail-focused NBFC in the country and the largest financier of consumer durables. Bajaj Finance Limited prides itself for holding the highest credit rating of FAAA/Stable for any NBFC in the country today.</p>
	              <p><strong>The Challenge<br>
                  </strong>Bajaj Finserv’s official You Tube channel had very little organic viewership and engagement. The YouTube channel had a number of videos, but those videos were not present in YouTube search results even for brand keywords. In fact, videos created by third-party vloggers, video reviewers and influencers were ranking for many generic and brand keywords in YouTube.</p>
	              <p>Also, the number of active subscribers was very low.</p>
	              <p><strong>The Solution<br>
                  </strong>Our solution was to deliver results that would genuinely impact the business. It would not be sufficient to just get the videos and/or channel to rank for generic and brand keywords. We needed to make sure the increased views would enhance audience engagement and retention thereby increasing overall awareness of the brand.</p>
	              <p>We devised a 360° approach to optimize the channel:</p>
	              <p>First, a comprehensive keyword research was undertaken. 500 keywords were identified and categorized product wise.<br>
	                Then, all videos on the channel were reviewed to understand the content and fitment with the keywords identified. The videos were then mapped to keywords which would be used to rank them for.<br>
	                Next, the videos were picked product wise and optimized for titles, descriptions and other video elements that impact rankings.<br>
	                This was followed by link building and social marketing. This helped get more likes and comments – important signals for ranking videos on You Tube.<br>
	                We updated the videos intros, end screens and video cards to increase engagement and retention metrics. The increased engagement helped boost the channel subscribers.<br>
	                We created video playlists on the Channel to prompt users to view other related videos on our channel. This would further enhance watch time of the Channel.<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong>	                The Results<br>
	                </strong>Our 360° approach to Video SEO &amp; YouTube Optimization helped deliver a massive improvement in rankings for the entire set of 500 keywords. Over the 5 month period from April ’18 to August ’18, the overall performance of the YouTube Channel improved immensely:</p>

	                <br>
                    <strong>                  Summary<br>
                  </strong>26th January is a national holiday, and no newspapers go into printing on this day, which in a way was a hurdle for the team as Sunday was a very crucial day for the film. Hence, the team came up with a strategy to overcome the absence of newspapers. </p>
	              <p><strong>Problem Statement/Objective<br>
	              </strong>Reviews would not be available to the audiences through newspapers on Sunday. So it was necessary to reach out to the right audience through social media platforms.</p>

	              </strong>“Practically every Indian is on digital platforms today, which means they are spread across various platforms like Facebook, YouTube, What’s App, Instagram. Influencers also play a key role in this digital era. We believe in reaching the audiences where they are rather than expecting them to come to us. The platform, the language being used has to be customised to appeal to the users,” explained Manish Kumar, CEO &amp; Founder, Digi Osmosis.</p>
	              <p>“We wanted to educate the audiences but at the same time didn’t want the film to be preachy.

		            TWITTER FACEBOOK GOOGLE + LINKEDIN<br>
	              Cause Marketing Case Study</p>
	            <p><strong>Category Introduction</strong></p>
	              <p>India is world’s one of the largest producer and consumers of tea.</p>
	              <p>Domestic consumption is ~ 1070 million kg. The market is vertically split between branded (~550 million kg) and unbranded/loose (520 million kg) tea segment. By value – branded tea is ~ Rs 15000 Cr per annum.</p>
	              <p>Domestic consumption is growing by ~5% by volume and ~7% by value. We feel the category would continue to grow – aided by secular trend of population growth as well as addition of new occasions.</p>
	              <p><strong>Brand Introduction</strong></p>
	              <p>Jaago Re was launched in 2007, transforming a humble cup of tea to a symbol of social awakening. While India is a nation that wakes up with a cup of tea in the morning, Jaago Re became the wakeup call for the society. Over the years, the campaign has challenged status quo and strived to drive the message of ‘be the change you wish to see in the society’.</p>
	              <p>While Jaago Re helped stir things up by urging the people to introspect and be the change makers, with Jaago Re 2.0 “Alarm Bajne Se PehleJaago Re”, Tata Tea aimed at changing the nature of ‘Reactivism’ to ‘Pre-activism’ – timely activism that could work towards preventing these unfortunate incidents from occurring.</p>
	              <p><strong>Marketing Objective for Social Media</strong></p>
	              <p><strong>Social Media Content Calendar 2019<br>
                  </strong>Build awareness and credibility for the brand campaign and generate conversations around the new brand approach of ‘pre-activism’ across relevant consumer touch points.<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong>	                Key focus areas were:</strong></p>
	              <p>Establish a stronger connection between Tata Tea and Jaago Re in the minds of people<br>
	                Get people to engage with Tata Tea<br>
	                Position Tata Tea as a thought-leader when it comes to social awakening, through original, hard-hitting social content<br>
	                Birth of Pre-Activism</p>
	              <p>Over the past decade, cause-based marketing was adopted by many brands leading to high levels of clutter. The brand’s voice was lost in this noise and in turn was affecting its share of mind.</p>
	              <p>We needed a disruption that could catapult Tata Tea’s cause-based messaging to a new level,” shares Puneet Das, Marketing Head – Tea, Tata Global Beverages.</p>
	              <p>For this, Tata Tea delved into society’s behaviour around activism itself.</p>
	              <p>“We reflected on our collective penchant for post facto activism; our self-righteous indignation and rage-filled presence at unfortunate occurrences after they have occurred. Can social activism be made more impactful? What behaviour should change to enable this?” In doing so, we realised and gave birth to a new idea: PRE-ACTIVISM. A preventive mind-set and behaviour that inspires people to prevent tragedies and take corrective actions before their occurrence,” Das shares.</p>
	              <p>India was roaring with anger when it saw poor performance in the Olympic. Everyone was blaming the poor facilities and funding those sports got. Over 3 lakh farmers have ended their lives since 1995 and there are 90 rapes every day.</p>
	              <p>Tata Tea introduced the idea with a television commercial revolving it around these three alarming issues; Rapes, Farmer suicides and inadequate sports facilities. The brand reflected on these issues and many more to demonstrate pre-activism as the new behaviour to prevent them from happening.</p>
	              <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
	              <p>To build thought leadership in the category<br>
	                Create buzz around the brand ‘Tata Tea’<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong>	                Brief</strong></p>
	              <p>The core remained the same:</p>
	              <p>Get a bigger share of mind by rekindling love for Tata Tea and get people to re-engage with the brand<br>
	                Reinstate its stature as a thought-leader<br>
	                But the brief was to re-position reposition Jaago Re and leverage the existing equity while doing something which is path breaking and completely different in terms of the idea as well as story-telling.</p>
	              <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
	              <p>Key challenge was to introduce the new concept of pre-activism by making it relevant to our consumers<br>
	                Drive conversations and eventually actions around it while delivering reach and frequency<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong>	                Execution</strong></p>
	              <p>Tata segregated their audience into 3 key segments depending on their propensity to adopt pre-activism, and developed content to reach out to them.</p>
	              <p>For the pre-activist who already understood the importance of acting to make a difference, the tea brand leveraged a host of influencers. For an audience who understood issues but whose action rested in digital and social action we looked at social publishers sharing this message.</p>
	              <p>For a mass that needed to understand the concept of pre-activism in their daily lives contextualized pre-activism through content.</p>
	              <p>The campaign was divided into three distinct phases, each with a different objective and execution approach:</p>
	              <p>Phase 1: Awaken people to pre-activism<br>
	                Phase 2: Inspire and facilitate Pre-activism<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong>Walk the talk on Pre-activism<br>
	                <br>
	                Phase 1</strong>: To seed the concept of ‘pre-activism’ and to ensure sustained levels of conversation and engagement, Tata Tea leveraged key consumer moments through micro campaigns that spelt out “how to pre-act”. From video featuring young girls asking their mothers relevant questions on gender bias on Women’s Day to a simple factoid video on how to save water when drinking tea on World Water Day, each micro-campaign created high impact for the brand across different platforms.</p>
	              <p><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Phase 2 of the campaign was aimed to inspire people to be a part of the change and pre-act on two critical issues:</p>
	              <p>Women Safety<br>
	                Lack of Sports Culture<br>
	                On each of the issues the brand encouraged people to pre-act by signing a petition which would be submitted to the HRD Ministry and pledge to bring about a change in their personal life:</p>
	              <p><strong>Issue 1: Women Safety<br>
                  </strong>Petition: To the HRD Ministry to make Gender Sensitization compulsory in school curriculum<br>
	                Pledge: Parents to practice /teach gender sensitivity to kids at home<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong>	                Issue 2: Lack of Sports Culture<br>
	                </strong>Petition: To the HRD Ministry to make sports as a compulsory subject in the school<br>
	                Pledge: Pledge to participate in and support at least one local sport event. Parents also pledge to take their children to these events<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Phase 3: TGBL Walked the Talk<br>
                      </strong>TGBL walked the talk on the two chosen issues and demonstrate pre-activism:</p>
	              <p>Women Safety<br>

	              Stree main</strong></p>
	            <p><strong>Brand Introduction</strong></p>
	              <p>Stree, a comedy-horror film of the year 2018, directed by Amar Kaushik and produced by Dinesh Vijan, Raj Nidimoru, and Krishna D.K. The film stars Rajkummar Rao and Shraddha Kapoor. </p>
	              <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
	              <p>Campaign was kick-started with circulating information about the ‘Legend of Stree’ via Wikipedia &amp; Digital PR along with an activity where Shraddha Kapoor archived her Instagram posts with a 3 posts grid which read ‘Mard Ko Dard Hoga’, following which memes were circulated all around and another activity #StreeSeSafe where fans ended up changing their Twitter headers to ‘O Stree Kal Aana’ in order to save themselves from Stree. A day prior to the launch, Rajkummar Rao archived his Instagram posts to a 3 posts grid which read ‘O Stree Kal Aana.’<br>
	                <br>
	                On the day of the trailer launch, the key poster was launched digitally with a call to action about trailer launch. The offline trailer launch was covered digitally. Keeping the horror factor in mind, the trailer launch happened at night around 8 pm. Additionally, users who participated in #StreeSeSafe activity also tweeted the trailer link through their profiles which generated great traction.<br>
	                <br>
	                Throughout the campaign, we released 4 songs along with their makings digitally and 5 dialogue promos which were shot exclusively and were not a part of the film which traveled well.<br>
	                <br>
	                To amplify the buzz &amp; to engage fans, a series of contests were run across platforms which gained good traction.<br>
	                <br>
	                Offline activities such as #SpotStree &amp; Stree Mirror Prank were amplified digitally.<br>
	                During the release week, multiple activities, as well as a Facebook Live session with the cast, was conducted which gave the film a final push.<br>
	                Objective</p>
	              <p>One of the key objectives while running the campaign was to establish the curiosity factor around the film, its one of a kind genre along with establishing a recall value around the film &amp; its release date.<br>
	                <br>
	                Since the film is based on a true phenomenon, another key objective was to build the legend of Stree for a larger audience digitally.<br>
	                <br>
	                Another important objective was to sustain the hype around the film, keep the audiences hooked and drive ticket sales.<br>
	                <br>
	                <strong>	                Creative Idea</strong></p>
	              <p>Entire campaign was executed across Facebook, Twitter &amp; Instagram.<br>
	                Majority of the assets were cross-promoted by a number of top portals which helped in wide visibility &amp; amplification.<br>
	                A number of digital associations such as RVCJ, Miss Malini, Arre, Terribly Tiny Tales, Pinkvilla etc. for the film helped in spreading the word around the film as well as create meaningful conversations.</p>
	              <p><strong>Execution</strong></p>
	              <p>As the film is based on a true phenomenon, one of the biggest challenges was to spread awareness about ‘The Legend of Stree’ among online audiences. There was a two-way approach for this:</p>
	              <p><strong>Social Media Content Calendar 2019<br>
                  </strong><br>
                  <strong>1. Circulate the information via Wikipedia –<br>
                  </strong>A Wikipedia page for ‘Stree’ was created where the plot along with a few details without giving out the entire story of the film was updated. This helped grab a good amount of eyeballs as none of the information was misleading and came from a reliable source.</p>
	              <p><strong>2. Websites, Influencer Outreach –<br>
	              </strong>Topmost websites, as well as influencers, had ‘Mard Ko Dard Hoga’ on their social media handles along with ‘Legend Of Stree’ articles floating around on the websites. This helped in spreading the word as well as garnered traction.</p>
	              <p>The main campaign for the film ‘Stree’ kic-started where Shraddha Kapoor archived her Instagram posts, leaving the profile with a 3 posts grid of “MARD KO DARD HOGA”, which is the tagline of the film, with no profile picture. The purpose behind this was to grab all the eyeballs and to build curiosity among people as to who is ‘Stree’ and why the tagline Mard Ko Dard Hoga?<br>
                    <br>
                    A follow-up activity #StreeSeSafe was done where fans ended up changing their Twitter headers to ‘O Stree Kal Aana’ in order to save themselves from Stree. An extension to this was the users tweeting the trailer as and when it launches.<br>
                    <br>
                    A day prior to the launch, Rajkummar Rao archived his Instagram posts to a 3 posts grid which read ‘O Stree Kal Aana.’<br>
                    <br>
                    In an exclusive tie-up with JIO Studios, the trailer of the film was launched exclusively on the JIO Cinema App first.<br>
                  On the day of Lunar Eclipse, a creative was put out with the messaging “Stree Ke Saaye Se TO Chand Bhi Nahi Bach Paaya!”</p>
	              <p>The first song from the film, ‘Milegi Milegi’ was popularised via multiple memes with the ‘Milegi Milegi’ angle to every situation. As an extension to this, Shraddha Kapoor interacted with a few fans keeping the ‘Milegi Milegi’ angle as its highlight. The idea was to popularise the lyrics of the song.</p>
	              <p>Amidst the usual contests floating on the internet, the song ‘Kamariya’ had a different twist post the launch. Fans &amp; followers witnessed ‘Nora Fatehi’ shaking her ‘Kamariya’ wherever she went with the messaging ‘Jaha bhi ho apni Kamariya Hilao’and asking users to send in their versions. The #KamariyaHilaDeChallenge was taken up by fans across the globe.</p>
	              <p>Throughout the campaign, sustenance posts were pushed through innovative pegs. Festivals as well as special days such as Independence Day, Friendship Day, Rakshabandhan etc. Posts had the ‘Stree’ angle to it.<br>
	                <br>
	                The dialogue promos shot exclusively for the digital campaign were pushed out with a unique context for each one which helped create buzz around the characters as well as the film.<br>
	                <br>
	                Throughout the campaign, a series of relatable memes for ‘Mard Ko Dard Hoga’, ‘Milegi Milegi’ &amp; ‘Aao Kabhi Haveli Pe’ which traveled well and ended up creating conversations and curiosity for the campaign as well as asset launches.<br>
                    <br>
                    Close to the film release, ‘Don’t Turn Around’ activity was observed across platforms which gave out the message of how one should not turn back if they want to save themselves from Stree.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>                  Challenges<br>
                    </strong>One of the topmost challenges were to create curiosity around the legend of Stree &amp; keeping the fans intrigued till the film release without revealing Stree’s identity. Whether Shraddha Kapoor is Stree or not was one of the talking points throughout the campaign and curiosity was to be maintained for the same.<br>
	                <br>
	                Since the film belongs to a niche genre of horror comedy, another challenge was to make sure that the campaign reaches out to a larger number of audience and isn’t limited to a particular set of viewers.<br>
	                With an influx of movies releasing with and around the film, another challenge was to make sure that <br>
	                <br>
  	                <strong>                  Results</strong></p>
	              <p>The film grossed over 30 Crores on its opening weekend and is about to enter the 100 Crore club.<br>
	                The positive box-office numbers proved that the curiosity &amp; intrigue around the film and its content was successfully established.<br>
	                <br>
                  “Filmmakers today understand the importance of the digital medium &amp; it’s direct impact on box office collections. While devising the marketing plan of Stree we decided to have a digital-first approach. The film &amp; its storytelling lends itself to the audience that first hears of any news via social media. The film is a marketing success with digital marketing’s contribution in the forefront” said Dinesh Vijan, Producer at Maddock Films.</p>
	              <p>“Stree was a unique opportunity given the premise &amp; the unexplored horror comedy genre which allowed us to experiment with the promotions as well. It’s worked fantastically and it’s been a great learning for all of us,” said Nikita Khandelwal , Head of Strategy at WWO</p>
